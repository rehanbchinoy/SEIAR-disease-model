Final project for Math 142 (Mathematical Modeling) at UCLA.

We used an SEIAR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious (Symptomatic), Asymptomatic, Recovered/Removed)
compartmental model to model the spread of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea in 2015.

This compartmental model was a system of five linear, autonomous, ordinary differential equations. We used MATLAB to find the equilibrium points and analyze the stability of the system in the neighborhood of these equilibria. 

We used the next-generation matrix from Diekmann et al to estimate the R_0, and found the daily vaccination rate required to impose R_0 < 1.

All coding was done in MATLAB. Please see the final presentation for more detail.
